My attempt to create an location based alarm application for Android.
Instead of setting a time based alarm, you set a location and a distance from that location of when you want to be notified about that you have arrived.<br>

<b>Usage:<br></b>
Sitting on the train, tired, and you want to sleep but the train might be late or early. You still want to sleep, but you are unable to set a time since you dont know when the train will arrive. 
By getting an alarm when you arrive to a selected location, simplyfies this.
