My attemot to create an location based alarm application for Android.
Instead of setting a time alarm, you set a location and a distance of when you want to be notified about that you have arrived.
Usage:
Sitting on the train, tired, and you want to sleep but the train might be late or early. You still want to sleep, but you are unable to set a time since you dont know when the train will arrive. 
By getting an alarm when you arrive to a selected location, simplyfies this.
